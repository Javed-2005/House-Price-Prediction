# House-Price-Prediction

# Introduction
Predicting house prices is an important objective. Recent studies have found that asset prices can help to forecast output and inflation. Changes in housing prices can provide knowledge about consumption and inflation. In the business cycle, housing market play an important role. Studying Housing sales and prices is necessary to understand demand and supply.

Models that can forecast housing prices can provide policy makers and economists with an idea about the future economy and therefore, help them design better policies. It can also help economists to estimate prepayments, housing mortgage and housing affordability. In recent years, machine learning has become a popular approach to predict house prices based on its attributes. Predicting house prices is usually approached as a regression problem.

# Dataset
Dataset
The housing dataset is available on Kaggle under “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques”. The “train.csv” file contains the training data and “test.csv” contains the testing data. The training data contains data for 1460 rows which corresponds to 1460 house’s data and 80 columns which correspond to the feature of those houses. Similarly, the testing data contains data of 1461 houses and their 79 attributes.

# Tasks-Performed
•	Pre-processed and performed feature engineering on data having more than 80 features to predict Housing prices
•	Performed Feature Scaling and One Hot Encoding on significant features selected from Heatmap
•	Applied models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost to achieve Root Mean Squared Error of 0.14155
